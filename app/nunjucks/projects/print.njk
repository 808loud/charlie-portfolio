		<p>I've had the honor to work with some great brands over the years. The exposure has taught me what needs to happen in order to make a business successful by really taking the time to learn their market and what makes it tick. Working in print offers a unique kind of engagement that no digital product can achieve. It forces you to think differently about a marketing strategy; not only in development but how and when it's executed.</p>
		<p>Below is a selection of projects that I have been responsible for. Some work has happened in collaboration with a team, while others were completed off-site working directly with the client.</p>

			<p>My work in print spans across virtually every medium and sector. I chose to focus these examples in markets that I have recent experience in, including retail, restaurant, and kids entertainment. Feel free to get in touch if there is a specific type of work you would like to see.</p>
