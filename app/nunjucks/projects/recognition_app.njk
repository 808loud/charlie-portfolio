	<p>A social recognition app targeted to Millennials with the idea that by engaging in their workforce you will earn their loyalty&ndash;and keep it for years to come. Employees and managers alike are enabled to show appreciation and emphasize that the work they're doing as a whole really is making a difference.</p><p>I worked on-site with a team of in-house developers, product managers, and creatives. I advised on strategy/creative, took part in planning meetings, developed user interfaces, developed graphics, and helped prepare files for hand off.</p>
