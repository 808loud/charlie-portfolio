Truck orders are fulfilled by their factory, while container orders allow direct access to factories that they have partnerships with. This feature also calculates the total amount of weight/space that an order would take up and does not allow customers to checkout until an order is filled.</p>
		<p>I partnered with CWT&amp;R to develop strategy, sitemaps, wireframes, low/high fidelity mockups, and final layouts. I worked with their project manager to source freelance developers for the front and backend. All work was done off site with the exception of a few on-site meetings with the team.</p>
