The process had to be fast and intuitive with the least amount of steps taken. They also wanted to rework their product description page to better reflect inventory, up-sell larger quantities, and cross-sell their own product line when appropriate. I worked mostly off-site advising on best practices in ecommerce and workflow. I also created wireframes, high-fidelity mock ups, presented creative, and produced final layouts.</p>

The prompt in the black bubble is then replaced with the users selection and changed to a blue bubble. This process repeats until the finder identifies a match. If an error is made the user can simply scroll up, tap a previous selection, and make a new one." )
