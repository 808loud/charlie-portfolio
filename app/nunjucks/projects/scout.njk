		<p>Scout needed a way to incentivize their employees by getting more recruiters to sign up for their services and grow its use among current customers. The solution was a rewards program that would increase visits to their site and use of their services. Scout Loyal features flexible rewards that are attractive to both recruiters and the companies they work for, and provides ways for Scout to show current customers they are valued.</p>
		<p>I worked mostly on-site to lead and mentor a small agency team. I was responsible for creative, wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, client presentations, final layouts, and style guides.</p>
